# HyperionDev cloned website

In my code I complete all of the requirements of the task and have documented it.

I got stuck mainly on the styling and started off trying to create custom CSS for the page but after a support session learned how useful bootstrap can be.

You will see that I have implemented bootstrap in most of the components and I look to improve on this.

I know it isnt an exact clone of the page but I believe what I have done is a sufficient demonstration of my skills and what I have learned.

This is something that I plan to build on as there are things I would like to improve such as the navbar and hamburger menu.

This is the link to the website I tasked myself to clone: https://www.hyperiondev.com/
